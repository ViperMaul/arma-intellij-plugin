    FIXED:
        unused variable check fixed for private vars in strings
        already private between private _var and private["_var"]
        Scope was wrong for this scenario:
            _i = 100;
            for [{private _i = 0}, {_i < 5}, {_i = _i + 1}] do {};
            hint str _i; // 100
