	FIXED: annotator: when private decl var is updated, variables aren't correctly checking if they are declared private or not. Their containing scope appear to be caching private decl var list.
	        I fixed this by NOT STORING THE VAR NAME and instead fetching it from node.getText
	fixed references!!!!
