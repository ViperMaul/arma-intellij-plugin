	fixed find usage type for SQF assignments

SQF
	FIXED: variables declared private in a high scope will still find variables in a lower scope that are declared private there (see example below and fn_virt_buy and click _price)
          	private t //private1

          	t=1;
          	if(..){
          		private t;
          		t //will be found by private1
          	}
    Changed functionality for when searching for already declared private vars in annotator. Now all private decl statements are searched for duplicate vars
    Now for each local variable in current scope, they are annotated if not declared private. A quick fix option is available to make them private
