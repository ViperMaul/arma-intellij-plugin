SQF
	ADDED:
        none
    CHANGED:
        removed optimizations to finding variable scope (cached declaration scope and privatization) because they resulted in wrong values
        variables set to nil will now be marked as uninitialized
        variables declared in params command that have no default value will be marked as "may be uninitialized" instead of more definitive "not initialized"
    FIXED:
        params [["_var", nil]];//was saying _var was defined when it shouldn't be
