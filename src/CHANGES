    CHANGED:
        none
    FIXED:
        string var in for loop not being referenced in code block
        variables in for spec do loop not being linked to those in the first code block in the array array, except for when declared private
            Example: this worked
            for [{private _i=0;},{true},{}] do {_i = _i + 1;};
            but not this (which is what was fixed)
            for [{_i=0;},{true},{}] do {_i = _i + 1;};
