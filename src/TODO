features:
    add tag renaming for functions
    check if function exists when doing call or spawn
    renaming files will rename them in includes


step up the scopes and list all variables. we should have utility method that will search for descendant elements without going deeper than the given scope.
    be careful to not go inside or escape spawn statements

for annotating if a variable is private, use the new method getPrivatization()

fix this scenario
_i = 100;
for [{private _i = 0}, {_i < 5}, {_i = _i + 1}] do {};
hint str _i; // 100
