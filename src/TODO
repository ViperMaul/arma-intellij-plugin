features:
    add tag renaming for functions
    check if function exists when doing call or spawn
    provide support for private _var
    renaming files will rename them in includes



fix this scenario: (but maybe not because it will mess up private declarations?)
_i = 100;
for [{private _i = 0}, {_i < 5}, {_i = _i + 1}] do {};
hint str _i; // 100
