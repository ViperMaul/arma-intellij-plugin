features:
    check if function exists when doing call or spawn
    renaming files will rename them in includes and if a SQF function, will rename the class decl

for dialog maker:
    snap should be in terms of percentage of canvas and not actual pixels

FIX THIS SCENARIO before release
_i = 100;
for [{private _i = 0}, {_i < 5}, {_i = _i + 1}] do {};
hint str _i; // 100


for header preprocessors, you will have to implement the lexer both times. However, use the current SQF version for both. Then have a shared TokenType called preprocessor
    We would also have a shared annotator that would look for these tokens and provide proper coloring and error checking
    We need to figure out how to provide references for them though
