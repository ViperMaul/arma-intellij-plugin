SQFVariableAsStringMixin
this is wrong because it won't find variables that are in strings (variableAsString). update PsiUtil to find child elements that are instanceof a certain psi type

public PsiReference[] getReferences() {
		ArrayList<ASTNode> nodes = PsiUtil.findChildElements(SQFPsiUtil.getCurrentScope(this), SQFTypes.VARIABLE, null, this.varName);

for SQFCompletionProvider, find local variables that match SQFScope with cursor's SQFScope


for armaUsageTypeProvider, Assignment type doesn't work

variables declared private in a high scope will still find variables in a lower scope that are declared private there (see example below and fn_virt_buy and click _price)
	private t //private1

	t=1;
	if(..){
		private t;
		t //will be found by private1
	}



for headerblock, have option for spaces before braces anywhere
