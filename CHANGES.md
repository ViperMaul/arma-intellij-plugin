**Notes**
* ArmaAddonsManager needs to finish ArmaAddonsIndexingCallback.java utilization by incrementing an addon's current work progress and total work progress
* What if we automatically mark any Addons in the current module that the user has (they are developing an addon) as a reference directory?
    We could reuse code this way. People could also reference other projects if we had multiple reference directories without needing to copy and paste stuff everywhere
