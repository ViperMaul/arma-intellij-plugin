This directory houses the wiki documentation for arma commands and BIS functions.
The documentation itself isn't committed to the repo to reduce the repo size.

To get the documentation files, open up a released
"Arma Intellij Plugin.jar" with 7zip or WinRar and navigate to "/src/com/kaylerrenslow/a3plugin/lang/sqf/raw_doc". There you will find
the files that will be placed in here. Be sure to copy over the "arma3-commands" and "arma3-functions" folders as a whole.
